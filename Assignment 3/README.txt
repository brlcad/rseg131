RSEG-131 Software Testing Techniques
Assignment 3, 21 November 2023
====================================

This third assignment was implemented fully per the instructions.
Carried over from Assignment 2, there is a Conversions class that
performs distance and temperature conversions.  There is now also a
Maven-based and Cucumber-based behavior-driven test setup that
validates the Conversions class behavior.  Included in the BDD testing
are positive cases, negative cases, testing of extreme values, and
more.

Compilation and running of the testing is provided via an included
compile.sh shell script which compiles the Conversions class and runs
Maven for our BDD testing.
